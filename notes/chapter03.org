#+TITLE: Chapter 03 - How to make a web app responsive with Bootstrap

* An introduction to responsive web design
- /responsive web design/ is making sure that web apps look good on devices of every size
  + apps that are mobile friendly perform better in Google's search results
- one way to make web apps responsive is to use CSS3 /media queries/
  + these let allow the layout of the page to be adjusted based on conditions, such as the width of the screen
- because it can be time consuming to develop media queries, frameworks have been developed to automate this process
- a /framework/ contains general code for common situations and can be customized to meet the needs of individual projects
- /Bootstrap/ is a popular framework for responsive web design that was originally developed by Twitter
  + Bootstrap uses CSS and JavaScript to make a web page automatically adjust for different screen sizes
** A responsive user interface
- when using Bootstrap, changes to the layout for various screen sizes happen automatically
** How to add cient-side libraries such as Bootstrap and jQuery
- how to add the Bootstrap and jQuery libraries to a web app
  1. in the Solution Explorer, expand the wwwroot/lib folder and delete any old Bootstrap or jQuery libraries
  2. in the Solution Explorer, right-click on the project name and select the `Add` -> `Client-Side Library` item
  3. in the dialog box that appears, type "jquery@", select "3.3.1" from the list that appears, click the `Install` button
  4. repeat steps 2 and 3 for teh library named "twitter-bootstrap@4.3.1", but change the target location to "www/lib/bootstrap"
  5. repeat steps 2 and 3 for the library named "jquery-validate@1.19.0"
  6. repeat steps 2 and 3 for the library named "jquery-validation-unobtrusive@3.2.11"
  7. in the Solution Explorer, expand the wwwroot/lib folder and view the libraries that have been installed
- the /Library Manager/, also known as /LibMan/, can be used to add client-side libraries to a project
- by convention, an ASP.NET Vore MVC app stores added libraries in the wwwroot/lib folder
** How to manage client-side libraries with LibMan
- to manage client-side libraries, open the libman.json file and edit it to specify the correct versions and locations for client-side libraries
- to update all client-side libraries, so they match the libman.json file, right-click on the libman.json file and select the Restore Client-side Libraries item
- to remove all client-side libraries, right-click on the libman.json file and select the Clean Client-Side Libraries item
** How to enable client-side libraries
- to make client-side CSS libraries available to the views in a web app, add the <link> elements for the CSS files to the <head> element in the Razor layout for the view
- the <link> element for the Bootstrap CSS file should be coded before the <link> element for any custom CSS files
  + this way, custom CSS styles override the Bootstrap styles
  + creating separate CSS stylesheets is the preferred way of making changes to Bootstrap
- to make client-side JS libraries available to the views in a web app, add the <script> elements for those libraries to the <head> element in the Razor layout for the view
  + the <script> element for the jQuery library should come first, then the <script> element for the Bootstrap JS file
- most of these libraries include a /minified/ version of the library that has removed unnecessary characters such as spaces and indentation
  + this decreases the size of the file and improves load time but makes it more difficult for humans to read the library
  + minified libraries are typically identified with a suffix of .min.css or .min.js
- after any necessary <link> and <script> elements have been added to the web form, VS provides IntelliSense for the Bootstrap CSS classes
- the /viewport/ is the part of the page that is visible to viewers
  + the /viewport meta tag/ controls the width of the viewport
- the MVC template may include an extra /dist folder for the Bootstrap, jQuery, and jQuery validation libraries
* How to get started with Bootstrap
** The classes of the Bootstrap grid system
- Valid class values
| Class                 | Description                                                                                                                     |

| col-/size/-/count/    | the number of columns an element should span on the specified screen sized; the number of columns in a row should not exceed 12 |
| offset-/size/-/count/ | the number of columns an elecent should be moved to the right on the specified screen size                                      |
- calid size values
| Size   | Description                                                                             |

| lg     | a large screen with a width greater than or equal to 1200 pixels (e.g. a large desktop) |
| md     | a medium screen with a width greater than or equal to 992 pixels (e.g. desktops)        |
| sm     | a small screen with a width greater than or equal to 768 pixels (e.g. tablets)          |
| (none) | an extra small screen with a width less than 768 pixels (e.g. phones)                   |
- Bootstrap uses a grid system based on containers, rows, and colummns
  + all rows should be inside a container, and each row must contain no more than 12 columns
- an element for each screen size can be assigned a different column class to specify the number of columns the element should span at those sizes
- if a column class is not assigned for a screen size, the class for the next smallest screen size will be used
** How the Bootstrap grid system works
- Bootstrap CSS uses /rem units/ for sizing
  + a rem (root em) unit works similarly to the mode traditional em unit, but its size is relatice to the root element rather than the current element

** How to provide context
- the context classes available to most elements
| Class     | Description                                          | Default color |

* More skills for Bootstrap components
- Bootstrap also provides its own /components/
** How to work with button groups
- common CSS classes for creating button groups
| Class              | Description                                                    |
|--------------------+----------------------------------------------------------------|
| btn-group          | groups two or more buttons with no padding between them        |
| btn-toolbar        | combines button groups with appropriate padding between groups |
| btn-group-/size/   | applies sizing to all buttons in a group; ex: `btn-group-lg`   |
| btn-group-vertical | stacks buttons in a group vertically rather than horizontally  |
- a /button group/ displays a group of buttons
- for assistive technologies to work correctly with button groups, the role attribute for button groups and toolbars needs to be set
  + in addition, the aria-label attribute should be specified
** How to work with icons and badges
- an /icon/ is a symbol that you use to decorate or add meaning to an element
- Bootstrap 3 included a set of icons called Glyphicons, but Bootstrap 4 does not include these
  + instead, the free icons available from Font Awesome can be used by including a <link> element to the CSS file fromm the Font Awesome website
    - this is typically placed just below the <link> element for Bootstrap
- to use an icon, include the base fas (Font Awesome Solid) class aling with the class for the individual icon you want to use
  + the classes are typically coded in a <span> element that's coded within another element
- FA icons do not have any padding by default
  + this can be adjusted by adding a nonbreaking space (`&nbsp;`) to the HTML or by using Bootstrap classes or CSS to add space
- when using icons, they should be made accessible
  + this is particularly important if an icon doesn't decorate accompanying text
    - if this case, content should be included to reflect the meaning of the icon that can be read by screen readers
  + if icons decorate accompaying text, they should be hidden so they don't confuse screen readers
- a /badge/ provides for hightlighting text within a component
** How to work with button dropdowns
- a /button dropdown/ can be created using the following classes and HTML5 element
| Class           | Description                                                  |

| Attribute       | Description                                                  |
|-----------------+--------------------------------------------------------------|
| data-toogle     | if set to "dropdown", makes a button dropdown                |
- to create a dopdown, a <button> element must be coded for the button and a <div> element that contains a dropdown menu
- a button dropdown needs the Popper.js library to work
- to make the dropdown menu work with assistive technologies, `aria-` attributes can be included
  + for this to work, teh dropdown menu can only include menu items, checkbox menu items, radio button menu items, radio button groups, and submenus
** How to work with list groups
- the CSS classes for /list groups/ allow a list of items such as links, buttons, and list items
  + a list group can also be nested within another list group
- common CSS classes for creating list groups
| Class           | Description                                         |
|-----------------+-----------------------------------------------------|
| list-group      | groups two or more items in a list or <div> element |
| list-group-item | styles the individual items in a list group         |
| active          | hightlights the list group                          |
| disabled        | grays out the list group item                       |
- it's common to write code that sets the active class when the app is running
  + that way, the active link can be changed depending on the user's actions
- similarly, the disabled class can be used to disable a link depending on the user's actions
** How to work with alerts and breadcrumbs
- /alerts/ allow for context feedback to be provided within an app
- common CSS classes and an HTML5 data attribute for creating alerts
| Class             | Description                                                                                                                        |

| alert-/context/   | applies a context class to an alert; ex: `alert-warning`                                                                           |
| alert-dismissable | makes an alert dismissible; the div for the alert should include a button that uses the close class and the data-dismiss attribute |
| alert-link        | styles links to match the styling of the alert that contains the link                                                              |
| close             | provides for closing an alert                                                                                                      |
